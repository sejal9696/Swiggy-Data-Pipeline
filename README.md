Practice Snowflake Data-pipeline Project  
Author - Sejal A Naik

Project Overview:
The project emulates the development of an end-to-end data pipeline using Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution. It encompasses various stages of data engineering, from data ingestion to transformation and visualization.

Key Objectives:
1. Data Ingestion: Simulate the extraction of data from Swiggy's operational systems, such as order details, customer information, and delivery logs.​
2. Data Storage: Utilize Snowflake to store raw data efficiently, leveraging its scalability and performance benefits.​
3. Data Transformation: Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean and structure the data, making it suitable for analysis.​
4. Data Modeling: Design a star schema or similar data model to organize the data logically, facilitating efficient querying and reporting.​
5. Data Visualization: Create dashboards and reports to derive insights, such as delivery times, customer satisfaction metrics, and operational bottlenecks.​
6. Automation and Scheduling: Set up automated workflows to ensure data pipelines run at scheduled intervals, maintaining up-to-date data for analysis.

Tools and Technologies:
1. Snowflake: For scalable and efficient data storage and processing.
2. ETL Tools: Such as Apache Airflow or dbt for orchestrating data workflows.
3. Programming Languages: SQL for data manipulation and scripting.

Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience in building a data pipeline from scratch.​
Understanding of data warehousing concepts and Snowflake's architecture.​
Proficiency in ETL processes and data modeling techniques.​
Ability to derive business insights through data visualization.
